Explanation:

1. `h2 + p`: This CSS selector targets a `p` element that directly follows an `h2` element. The style sets the text color of such paragraphs to royalblue. In this example, it applies to the second paragraph.

2. `p i`: This CSS selector targets the italicized (`<i>`) text within a `p` element. The style sets the text color of the italicized text to red. This is applied to the word "consectetur" in the second paragraph.

The HTML document contains a heading (`<h2>My super site</h2>`) and two paragraphs. The applied styles in the CSS section add visual enhancements to specific elements in the paragraphs based on the defined selectors. The comments in the code provide explanations for each section.
